# 30 Days of JavaScript üöÄ

Welcome to my 30-day JavaScript challenge!  
This repository contains a collection of small projects I‚Äôm building daily to improve my JavaScript skills, learn new concepts, and build consistency. Each day features a new mini-project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript ‚Äî from basic DOM manipulation to more advanced functionality.

## üéØ Goals
- Practice JavaScript consistently
- Learn by building small real-world projects
- Strengthen frontend development skills
- Build a portfolio to showcase my progress

## üìÅ Structure
Each day/project is in its own folder and includes:
- `index.html`
- `style.css`
- `script.js`
